# Welcome to CatSpace™!

> **Note:** Dogs are **definitely not** invited to the party.

It's a free Angular-based memory card game that definitely delivers its promises.


## Features
The game lets you get an infinite amount of cats from the infamous [CAT API](https://thecatapi.com). You also have the chance to put your memory to the test with beautifully crafted 16 cards. It tracks your tries so you can challenge yourself and your friends.

### What it doesn't do:
- Competitive (Versus) Mode
- Fancy animations
- Match timer and ✨ **High Score** ✨ counter
- Dark mode :(
